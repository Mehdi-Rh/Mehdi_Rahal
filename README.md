## [Project 3: Analyse A/B test results](https://github.com/Mehdi-Rh/Analyse_AB_Test_Results)

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. It is important that you get some practice working with the difficulties of these
In this notebook, an A/B test is runned by an e-commerce website, the goal is to understand if the company shouldimplement the new page , keep the old page or run the expriment longer to make their decision
<br><br>Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook

## [Project 4:  Investigate-a-DataSet](https://github.com/Mehdi-Rh/Investigate-a-DataSet)

In this project a dataset named 'Medical Appointment No Shows' is investigated.
<br>This dataset contains information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil in the 2015 and 2016, the main aspect in this dataset is if a patient show up for its appointment or not.
<br>The main question in this investigation is : What factors are important for us to know in order to predict if a patient will show up for their scheduled appointment
### Conclusion
<br>According to my investigation there is no way to predict efficiently if a patient will show up or not.

<br>To answer to the main question wich asks to determine the most important feature to predict if a patient will show up or not:
Except the PatientId and the AppointmentID, each feature can lightly help to do the prediction (but with a very low accuracy)

### Limitation

<br>The dataset is limited in term of quantity of data, with data of more years the investigation can be more efficient
<br><br>Tools: Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
